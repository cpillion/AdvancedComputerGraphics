Homework 8 - Textures for Data Storage
Chris Pillion

SOURCE LANGUAGE:
  C++

COMPILE USING:
  qmake
  make

RUN USING:
  hw08

ACTIONS:
  All actions are executed on the Qt Widget.
  The shader combobox enables the shader. By default, the shader is off. 
  Map Size applies a scale factor to the xz axis of the map. 
  Peak size applies a scale factor to the height differences.
  Reset to reset to dim and angles of 45.
  Quit to quit
  
TIME TO COMPLETE:
  ~20 hours

NOTES:
There are still a lot of things I would like to refine and do for this, and I ran into many obstacles, but perhaps I can wrap this into my final project somehow and refine it for the areas I had issues. 
Sometimes, the shader combobox selection gets stuck (not sure why) - restarting the program tends to fix the problem.
